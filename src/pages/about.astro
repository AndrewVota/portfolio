		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			Hey 👋🏼, I'm Andrew Vota, a software engineer specializing in
			full-stack development with an affinity for crafting versatile web
			frontends and robust Java or Go backends.
		</p>
		<p>
			Driven by an unyielding passion for tech, my journey is marked by an
			ongoing quest for knowledge. I’m constantly exploring new
			technologies. Whether it's refining my current stack or diving into
			the next innovation, I'm dedicated to mastering the tools that will
			define the future of development.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this fast-paced digital world, I believe that staying still is
			falling behind. That's why I'm always tuned into the latest tech
			trends, keen to experiment with emerging technologies that push the
			boundaries of what's possible. My goal is to not just keep up with
			the digital evolution, but to be a part of driving it.
